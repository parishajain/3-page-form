<p>Who am I ? That is a deep question. I need to do a lot of soul searching. Looking back at my life, I don't
	feel I have done anything good for anyone. According to Plato's philosophy, I did not live a virtuous life.
	I did nothing better than an average animal. The only thing I can say for my credit is that I took good care of
	my sons and they became responsible, educated adults with high moral standards.
